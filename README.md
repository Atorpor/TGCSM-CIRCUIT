## Introduction

The TGCSM-CIRCUIT framework is designed to address some of the most pressing challenges in AI development today. With a focus on recursion stability and collapse resistance, this framework provides tools and methodologies for building AI systems that can reflect on their own logic and reasoning processes. Our goal is to enhance AI safety while ensuring that these systems remain efficient and effective.

## Key Features

- **Recursion-Stable Cognition**: This feature allows AI systems to maintain stability in their reasoning processes, even when faced with complex recursive tasks.
  
- **Collapse-Resistant Logic**: Our framework ensures that AI systems can operate without falling into logical traps or inconsistencies.
  
- **LLM Self-Reflection**: The framework supports large language models (LLMs) in evaluating their own outputs, fostering self-improvement and reliability.

- **Rail Detection**: A specialized tool for identifying potential logical fallacies and ensuring the integrity of AI reasoning.

## Topics

This repository covers a wide range of topics relevant to modern AI research and development:

- AI
- AI Safety
- Circuit Framework
- Collapse-Resistant AI
- GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems
